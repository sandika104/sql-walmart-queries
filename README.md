## About
About This project contains a description of the performance of each existing product, city and branch by considering customer behavior towards other variables.
I only use SQL language to describe each data and look for new meanings to answer existing questions.


## Analysis List
1. Product Analysis
   First I carried out a product analysis to find out the relationship between the product and other variables. Then see whether there needs to be a review of the performance of existing products.
2. Customer analysis
   Especially to determine customer behavior towards purchasing products. I also look for dominance in which segments customers buy a product.
3. Sales Analysis
   Finally I conducted a sales review by looking at product performance and customer trends. This information is compiled to support decision making.
